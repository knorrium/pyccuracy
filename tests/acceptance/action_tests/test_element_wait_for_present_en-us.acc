As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the wait for element to show action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that I can wait for an element to load using the default 30 seconds
Given
    I go to "page_tests.htm"
When
    I wait for "divWaitForVisible" element to be present
Then
    I see "divWaitForVisible" div

Scenario 2 - Checking that I can wait for an element to load for a given number of seconds
Given
    I go to "page_tests.htm"
When
    I wait for "divWaitForVisible" element to be present for 10 seconds
Then
    I see "divWaitForVisible" div
